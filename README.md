## Description

This a very simple match-3 game created with only HTML and JavaScript. It allows users to try to make rows or columns of 3 or more tiles of the same color. Those tiles will then clear and shift to fill the game board with new tiles. Any newly rendered tiles that are already matches will automatically clear and be added to the point total. The user can see their score and see available moves if they are stuck. If no further moves can be made the game ends. The user can begin a new game at any time.

## Installation

There is no installation needed, the game can be played in the browser as-is.

## Usage

To use, simply open the application in a browser window and begin either dragging or clicking an selecting tiles to swap with another either above, below, to the left, or to the right of it to make a row or column of at least 3 tiles of the same color. Clicking "New Game" will reset the board to a random set of tiles - this can be done at any time but is necessary to begin a new game when there are no more available moves to make. Clicking "Show Moves" will place markers on any available moves if help is needed. The button text will change to "Hide Moves" and will remove the markers upon clicking again.
